User Registration Flow
Register Controller → Register Service → User Repository

When a user submits a registration request, the Register Controller processes the request from the MVC layer and forwards it to the Register Service.
The Register Service validates the provided information and ensures data integrity.
Once validated, the user data is saved in the database via the User Repository, which handles all database interactions.
User Login Flow
Login Controller → Login Service → User Repository

When a login request is received, the Login Controller forwards it to the Login Service.
The Login Service performs authentication and authorization, relying on Spring Security to verify user credentials.
The User Repository retrieves user data from the database to complete the login process.
Company Search & Stock Prediction Flow
Business Controller → Business Service → LSTM Service → Company Repository / Transaction History Repository

The Business Controller receives requests related to listed companies and forwards them to the Business Service.
The Business Service contains the core business logic, managing company selection and retrieving historical data through the Company Repository and Transaction History Repository.
Once the historical data is retrieved, a request is sent to the LSTM Service, which forecasts the company's stock price for the next month.
